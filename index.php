                          <p>Skip the third parties and organizations who promise that your donations will help the community when they take a chunk of your proceeds to pay themselves. Lets simplify things and be direct. "You need children's clothes, I have children's clothes that no longer fit my kids. I was going to donate to a thrift store, but let me give it to you instead. Let me help you."</p>

        <h2>Why Hand2Heart?</h2>
        <div>

Our goal is to connect those who want to help with those that truly need it.</p>
            <p>If you have a good or service that you want to "give away", we guarantee, there is a family or a person in need of it. These people in need have a way to tell their story to an audience ready and willing to listen.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>Because Sometimes Goodwill and GoFundMe Aren't Enough</h3>
            <p>Sometimes, the people in our community need a good or service that neither Goodwill nor GoFundMe can provide. At Hand2Heart, we strive to make sure their voices are heard and their needs are met. 
            In addition, we don't take any of the profit from those giving or receiving, unlike some other "charitable" organizations. You can see exactly where and to whom your goods and services go. While we understand that there are people in need all over the country and world, there are people right in your vicinity that you can help if you're able.</p>

            <p>I've recently been diagnoased with cancer, been widowed for 5 years, and no children who live near me. The last thing I needed to have happen to me was damage done from the hailstorm in my area. With Hand2Heart, I was connected with people who were ready and willing to help me out. I'm where I am now because of their assistance!</p>

            </figure>
            <p>I was a bit foolish with my money and didn't properly save for my family and I. When I lost my job, I had no idea how I was going to provide for them. Thankfully, Hand2Heart was there to assist with food and clothing. I wouldn't have had the courage to pick myself and do better for my family without the assistance of Hand2Heart and the people they connected me to.</p>

            <p>I was never comfortable after reading stories about how my donations weren't really going to help those in need, especially those in my community. With Hand2Heart, I was able to offer a varity of my services, from donating unworn clothes to being a volunteer English conversation partner for those in my community. I could engage with them on a more personal level and could see exactly who I was impacting with my service.</p>
